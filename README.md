# Intake for Tevo Tarantula PSU

***Work in progress***

This is version one of a sleek intake for the power supply used with the Tevo Tarantula printer, this is meant to be used in heated chambers to reduce the heat in the power supply, this sis also meant to be used with an exhaust (Design coming soon).

Once this is complete, ill post instructions for assembly and printing over at my Thingiverse page!
